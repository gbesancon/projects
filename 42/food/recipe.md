## Food
Magret séché
Ingredient :

Recette :
 - couvrir de gros sel dans un saladier

Pizza Dough (2 pizzas)
- 500g flour
- 25 g brewer's yeast
- 1 little spoon of salt
- 2 glass of warm (not hot) water
Steps:
- put the two glass of water in a bowl with the yeast and blend them
- put the flour in a big bowl and create a hole in the middle of the flour.
- put half of the water-yeast in the hole and add the spoon of salt.
- start to knead everything with one hand 
- add the remaining water-yeast gradually (and a little of flour if the dough is too soaked)
- knead everything until it becomes a homogeneous and smooth sphere
- let the dough rest for 2 hours (the volume must double) in a bowl covered with kitchen foil or a cloth.
- after the two hours, separate the dough in two parts and stretch them (do the pizza shape). Leave the two pizza for 10 minutes (they need to rest after you stretched them)
- I baked the two pizzas with tomato sauce (passata) for 5 minutes at 200 degrees, and then I added mozzarella slices. Then cook them for other 5/6 minutes
